# QUIZ BOARD
## Description
 A website on which students can take HTML test. Users will answer the multiple choice questions on the website, and know their score immediately.

## Features
1. As a user, I want to see the multi-choice questions when the website loads. You will create the multi-choice questions to be answered on the website. Each question should have a number of points awarded when scored right.
2. As a user, I want to select the answer which I think is correct from the webpage.
3. As a user, I want to submit my answers when I'm done taking the quiz.
4. As a user, I want to get the results of what I scored after submitting my answers on the website.
